## üí• Introduction

Being a frontend developer, I realized the importance of having my own digital footprint.
So, I decided to create my own [website](http://olgaswan.com/). This site serves a dual purpose - it's a platform where
I can display my work, and also a space for me to express my thoughts through blog posts.

## üöÄ Features

- **Block-style editor**: allows to create articles composed of different types of content blocks. These blocks can
  include titles, paragraphs, Markdown-formatted text, iframes for embedding content, code snippets, and images. This
  feature gives flexibility in structuring articles by combining these various block types to create engaging and
  diverse content.
- **Tag filtering**: Using tags, users can explore content based on particular topics, themes, or categories. Each diary
  is associated with one or more tags that reflect its subject matter.
- **Cloud Firestore Integration**: Firebase's seamless integration simplifies data storage and synchronization, ensuring
  real-time updates across devices and platforms.
- **grommet framework**: provides a set of UI components designed for accessibility, modularity, and responsiveness. Its
  theming capabilities ensure a consistent and visually appealing user interface across the application.
- **Animations**: tilting diary card animation creates an interaction with the content previews. Parallax animation
  bring a dynamic, multi-layered effect to content as users scroll.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local development

To ensure that you are able to install everything properly, I would recommend you to have <b>Yarn</b>, <b>React</b>
and <b>Vite</b> installed.
Once everything is set up, run the commands:

- `yarn` to install dependencies,
- `yarn develop` to start local dev server,
- `yarn test` to run tests,
- `yarn format` to format and lint,

Also, you could check other scripts in [package.json](./package.json).

If you have any development ideas, feel free to create a pull request or message me.
